# HOW IT WORKS
This script prints line by line whatever is in your file.log (it also works with txt files).

I recommend using an evironment key as shown at line 28 as it's not safe to have any passwords in any scripts. The way you enable an evironment key is by going over to System Properties > Environment Variables > User Variables > New. Once you have your environment key you want to give it a name and a value, then use that name where it says "email_sender_password".
