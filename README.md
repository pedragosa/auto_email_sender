# HOW IT WORKS
This script prints line by line whatever is in your file.log (it also works with txt files).

I recommend using an eviroment key as shown at line 28 for your password as it's not safe you have password in your scripts. The way you enable an evironment key is by going over to System Properties > Environment Variables > User Variables > New. Once you have your environment key you want to give it a name and then use that name where it says "email_sender_password".
